*****IMPORT SETTINGS****

Make sure the 'Convert Units' box is unchecked within the Import Settings! 
This should be defaulted upon import. Make sure to uncheck it in case it is not.
If the user decides to have this option enabled then the 'Scale Factor' of the models has to be set to 100.
Please take a quick look at the pdf document provided to better understand how to set up your characters.


Happy development!
